# Emotion Detection Project

A real-time facial emotion detection system that classifies emotions into seven categories: angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad, and surprised. This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the FER-2013 dataset to provide accurate emotion predictions from live video feeds.
